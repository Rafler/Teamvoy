## Teamvoy Test Task
Hello,\
Welcome to my realisation of test task.\
Here is a little description about my work:

1. To see Demo - click on [Demo link](https://rafler.github.io/Teamvoy/)
2. To run my app on your device use `npm start`.
3. All my files are situated on the branch `develop`.
4. There is a lot of specific classnames. It's caused because I use Semantic UI.\
Therefore, if you have used Semantic, you know that it requires complicated structures to change built in styles.

Thanks for your time being spent here.\
Waiting for the result and feedback from you.
